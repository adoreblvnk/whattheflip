# Embedded Systems Project: Autonomous Robotic Car Challenge

## Project Overview

This project involves the design, development, integration, and testing of an autonomous robotic car capable of navigating a predefined course. The robotic car must operate independently using onboard sensors and embedded software without remote control.

The course consists of:
- A line-following track
- Directional barcodes placed at selected locations
- Speed humps of varying heights
- Static obstacles placed along the track

The robotic car must navigate the course while collecting environmental information and making autonomous decisions based on sensor inputs.

The project emphasises:
- Embedded systems design
- Sensor integration
- Resource-efficient programming
- Real-time decision making
- Autonomous navigation
- Hardware-software co-design

As embedded systems are inherently resource-constrained, teams are expected to design efficient software and make prudent use of processing, memory, communication, and power resources.

Performance assessment will consider:
- Navigation accuracy
- Completion time
- Reliability
- Code quality
- Resource efficiency
- System robustness

## Mission Requirements

The robotic car shall:
1. Follow a line track autonomously.
2. Detect and decode barcodes positioned along the track.
3. Execute navigation commands encoded by barcodes:
   - Turn Left
   - Turn Right
   - Go Straight
   - U-Turn
4. Detect humps encountered along the route.
5. Measure and report the highest hump peak experienced during the run.
6. Detect obstacles located on or near the line.
7. Profile obstacle shape and position using ultrasonic sensing.
8. Navigate around obstacles while avoiding collisions.
9. Reacquire the original line after bypassing an obstacle.
10. Report telemetry data through WiFi communication.

## Expected System Behaviour

### Line Following
The robot shall continuously track the black line using IR sensors. The line-following algorithm should be robust against:
- Minor lighting changes
- Slight track imperfections
- Speed variations

### Barcode Navigation
Barcodes will be placed at selected locations along the route. Upon detecting a barcode, the robot shall decode the command and perform the corresponding action.

| Barcode | Command |
|---|---|
| A | Turn Left |
| B | Turn Right |
| C | Go Straight |
| D | U-Turn |

Navigation decisions must be executed accurately using encoder-based motion control.

### Hump Detection
The course may contain one or more humps. The robot shall:
- Detect hump using IMU data
- Estimate hump height using IMU data

### Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
Obstacles may appear directly on the line path. When an obstacle is detected:
1. The robot shall stop or slow down.
2. The ultrasonic scanning system shall profile the obstacle.
3. The robot shall determine a safe bypass route.
4. The robot shall leave the line temporarily.
5. Navigate around the obstacle.
6. Search for and reacquire the original line.
7. Continue normal operation.
8. The avoidance behaviour should minimise deviation from the original route.
